# Nestle Chatbot Demo
This AI-based chatbot integrates with the homepage of Nestle and can fully function as a customer service agent

# Steps to running the Chatbot Locally
Because the backend API can be accessed via a public address you can run this sample by running the following commands

- `cd app/frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

You can optionally change the fetch endpoint to `localhost` and run the fastAPI program locally.
To run the server locally
- `cd app/backend`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `fastapi dev chat.py`
